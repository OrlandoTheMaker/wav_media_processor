# wav_media_processor
A .wav media preprocessing script for Data Analysts & Machine learning Engineers.

* This script utilizes the librosa library in python.
* It helps data analysts extract Mel-Frequency Cepstral Co-efficients(MFCC) features from audio files.
* This particular code is only meant to extract features from .wav files.
* But users with python programming knowledge can be able to tweak the code to work on other audio file extentions
